# final-project-moop

This is the final project for Mobile Object-Oriented Programming Course. The requirement for this project is to build an application which consist of a minimum of 2 activities, built using Java, and should using some kind of storage.

So for this project I built an application named MovieWatchlist, which consist of 3 activities. The way the application works is similar to wishlist mechanism that can be found in many e-commerce websites. In the first activity, the user can search a movie by title, then the application will create a request to an API called OMDb API an get a list of movies corresponding to the title submitted by the user. And then the user can click the heart icon in the card to add the movie to their watchlist.

The second activity is the watchlist itself where the user can see all the movies in their watchlist. When the movie card is clicked, it will open a new activity which show the movie's detail information. To remove a movie from watchlist, user can simply click the red heart icon in corresponding movie card.
