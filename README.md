# final-project-moop

This is the final project for Mobile Object-Oriented Programming Course. The requirement for this project is to build an application that consists of a minimum of 2 activities, built using Java, and should using some kind of storage.

So for this project, I built an application named MovieWatchlist, which consists of 3 activities. The way the application works is similar to the wishlist mechanism that can be found on many e-commerce websites. In the first activity, the user can search a movie by title, then the application will create a request to an API called OMDb API and get a list of movies corresponding to the title submitted by the user. And then the user can click the heart icon on the card to add the movie to their watchlist.

The second activity is the watchlist itself where the user can see all the movies on their watchlist. When the movie card is clicked, it will open a new activity that shows the movie's detailed information. To remove a movie from the watchlist, the user can simply click the red heart icon on the corresponding movie card.
